# Gemini AI Chatbot 💬  

A simple **AI chatbot** powered by **Google’s Gemini API**, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project was created as a personal learning exercise to improve my **frontend development skills** while experimenting with AI integration.

## 🧠 Project Overview
The chatbot allows users to interact with the Gemini AI model through a clean and responsive web interface.  
It demonstrates how to:
- Send asynchronous API requests using `fetch` and `async/await`
- Handle user input dynamically
- Display AI responses in a chat-style layout
- Manage API errors gracefully
- Practice modern web development principles (HTML, CSS, JS)

## 🚀 Features
- Responsive chat UI  
- Real-time conversation with Gemini AI  
- Loading/typing indicators  
- Clean and minimal design  
- Modular and beginner-friendly JavaScript  
- Easily customizable styles

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Page structure and chat layout  
- **CSS3** – Styling and animations  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Logic, interactivity, and API calls  
- **Google Gemini API** – AI responses

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User enters a message in the chat box.  
2. The message is sent to the Gemini API endpoint using `fetch()`.  
3. The chatbot waits asynchronously for a response.  
4. Once received, the response is displayed in the chat interface.
